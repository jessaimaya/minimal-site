# These files will be removed during merge - they are build artifacts that should be ignored

The following files are causing merge conflicts because they are build artifacts that were previously committed but should now be ignored:

- src/native/macroquad/fractal-trees/target/.rustc_info.json
- src/native/macroquad/fractal-trees/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/.fingerprint/fractal-trees-54922592a7c6bd1f/output-lib-fractal_trees  
- src/native/macroquad/fractal-trees/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/deps/fractal_trees.wasm
- src/native/macroquad/fractal-trees/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fractal_trees.wasm

These will be automatically removed when the merge is resolved.
