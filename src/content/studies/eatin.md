title: 'EatIn App'
position: 'FullStack & Designer'
description: "Through an App, instantly connect starving eaters with home cooks offering their home-made food dishes. Users and cooks can choose between enjoying food at the cook's home, pick their food up or get it delivered."
task:
    - Develop a mobile-first UI/UX using React Native, ensuring smooth interactions across devices.
    - Create separate dashboards for cooks to manage their meals, track orders, and view reviews, and for eaters to browse meals and track orders.
    - Implement dynamic search and filtering for eaters to find meals based on cuisine, location, price, and availability.
    - Build an intuitive ordering system with secure checkout, order history, and live order status.
    - Create wireframes and prototypes using Figma, to visualize the app’s flow for both cooks and eaters.
    - Define user journeys for both cooks and eaters to ensure that their paths through the app are efficient and enjoyable.
    - Implement tests for both frontend and backend components, ensuring everything functions as expected.
    - Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to ensure automated testing and reliable deployments of new features and updates.
    - Integrate Google Maps or another geolocation API for real-time cook discovery, meal delivery tracking, and proximity-based recommendations.

Our first concern was delivering a **functional prototype fast**; every choice had great weight. Knowing what would fit inside the schedule and having experience let me choose the **correct tools for every task**.

Manual testing and deployment took time, hence we developed **automated workflows** using constant integration and delivery **(CI/CD)**. This greatly cut the time spent _building, installing, and testing_ on cellphones by allowing us to perform integration tests effectively and show _progress without delay_.

Using already-existing systems including _Heroku, TestFlight, GitHub Actions, and Device Farm_ let us avoid starting from scratch with infrastructure building. **"Standing on the shoulders of giants"** let us concentrate on the central offering rather than _reinventing the wheel_.

Our design process's web-based, collaborative character and emphasis on web/app design led me to suggest **Figma**. Considering _colors, themes, user interactions, and performance_, I developed a **design system** that fit quite well in a _component library_. Better abstraction and efficiency in design were made possible by my developer perspective.

Working on the **back-end and both front-end** apps allowed me _complete control_ over the user flow—from registration to order creation and content uploads. With every iteration, our custom-made CI/CD pipeline saved a great deal of time.

Thanks to the **agile methodology** we developed, we were happy with the outcome when we effectively introduced a _functional prototype in three to four months_.
