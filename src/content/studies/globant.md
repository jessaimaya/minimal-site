    - "Ensuring backward compatibility with new features is difficult since earlier systems were not built for easy extension."
    - "Refactoring without damaging current functionality is challenging, especially when there are intricate dependencies across teams."
    - "Cross-team cooperation can cause delays since changes in one area affect others, requiring constant communication."
    - "Legacy code frequently lacks tests, requiring me to develop new tests or retrospectively cover old code, increasing the chance of errors."
    - "Maintaining test quality in CI/CD pipelines is challenging, especially when legacy systems were not built with continuous integration in mind."
    - "Technical debt hinders progress, necessitating the cleanup of old code before adding new functionality to prevent further degradation."
    - "New features can cause performance bottlenecks, prompting me to optimize without affecting the legacy system."
    - "Version control disputes arise often among different teams, necessitating cautious merging and conflict resolution."
    - "Compliance difficulties frequently develop, particularly in regulated businesses, making it critical to ensure that new features fulfill all applicable standards."

It is essential to **document** not only in the code, but also in a shared knowledge base such as _Confluence_ or a wiki, so that future teams can access this information.

I prioritize producing **legible code above "smart" code** since high-level languages like JavaScript are designed to be **understood by humans, not machines**.

**Automated tests and code coverage** are only the beginning for code reviews. The true benefit comes from providing **feedback** and cooperating on changes.

Clear and comprehensive **ticket refinement** is essential for a successful sprint. **Addressing any ambiguities** before allocating jobs helps to avoid bottlenecks and confusion later in the process.

**Knowledge sharing** is a fundamental value of mine. The more we share insights and expertise with our team, the stronger and more effective we become. **Collaboration drives progress**, and we grow as a team when we support each other's growth.
