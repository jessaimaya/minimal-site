During **seven years** working as a web developer, I have personally seen front-end development change. Early on, _responsive design and cross-browser_ compatibility were major difficulties particularly with legacy browsers like **Internet Explorer**. This time let me realize the need of flexibility and keeping performance on devices with minimal resources. As **mobile-first** became the standard, I discovered how to create _fluid, adaptable layouts—often_ without reference to contemporary frameworks.

I moved to create **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**, which demanded a change in thinking particularly around state management and routing, as _JavaScript frameworks_ like **Angular and React** developed. I came to see during this period the need of keeping modular, clear code to control ever more complicated applications. For _controlling dependencies_ and guaranteeing compatibility across systems, tools like **Webpack and Babel** become indispensable. Including new frameworks into historical codebases also helped me to see the value of deliberate migrations depending more on need than hype.

By 2017, state management—especially with regard to **Redux**—had taken the stage with creating major projects. _Testing_ also started to take the stage since tools like **Jest and Cypress** guarantee dependability in SPAs. Using codes-splitting and slow loading to maintain apps responsive despite increasing complexity, I discovered how to _maximize for performance_. **TypeScript** enabled me to balance the needs of new technologies with writing more dependable, maintainable code.

Later years saw **SSR and SSG** become absolutely essential for providing quicker, more search engine optimized experiences. Using **GraphQL and Progressive Web Apps** (PWAs) also helped me to better grasp how to create contemporary, performable, and effective online apps. Especially with **React Hooks**, _component-based development_ became a basic paradigm that helped me to design scalable, reusable codebases capable of changing with changing customer requirements.
